## Browser support, development reason

Wrote for *Desktop Chrome 83*, but it look's like works in *Desktop Firefox 77* too. *Desktop Safari 12.1.1 on Mac OS 10.14.5* works like a charm. It wood be great to test on iPad mobile safari. The application is written as an example of usage [material-ui-umd](https://github.com/tripolskypetr/material-ui-umd) in practice. If it’s not difficult for you, a ⭐️ will be appreciated
